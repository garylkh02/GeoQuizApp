# GeoQuiz Application
This is a project for the subject Mobile Application Development. This project required us to build a complete GeoQuiz Android application and fulfill the following requirements at the same time by using Kotlin programming language.

//In additional of the Next Button, add a Previous Button: Add a button that the user can press to go back one question.

//Preventing Repeat Answers: Once a user provides an answer for a particular question, disable the buttons for that question to prevent multiple answers being entered.

//Graded Quiz: After the user provides answers for all of the quiz questions, display a Toast with a percentage score for the quiz.

//Reset Quiz: Add in a button to reset the Quiz (to enable all the buttons and reset the scores).
 
//Closing Loopholes for Cheaters:
a. Users can rotate CheatActivity after they cheat to clear out the cheating result.
b. Once they get back from CheatActivity, users can rotate QuizActivity to clear out
mIsCheater.

//Limited Cheats: Allow the user to cheat a maximum of three times. Keep track of the user’s cheat occurrences and display the number of remaining cheat tokens below the cheat button. If no tokens remain, disable the cheat button.

//Result Summary: Add a ‘Result Summary’ button in QuizActivity, when user click on it, will bring the user to a new page showing the summary of the Total Question Answered, Total Score and Total Cheat Attempts.

//Include additional feature that may improve the GeoQuiz app.
